I joined Principal as a fresher and now it's been more than 5 years that I have been working in this organization, and the learnings and growth opportunities that I got are tremendous.

    As a trainee, there's a thorough training provided on the business as well as the technical knowledge. It is made sure that when you start working with other experienced employees you have the required skills to start grasping the vast knowledge at the same time start contributing to the projects. It gives great exposure and learnings when you collaborate with employees of Home Office (US). Working in a Fortune 500 company gives a great sense of pride, as each effort of yours would make a huge Impact.

    PGS takes care and encourages feedbacks in making sure its employees are getting the required trainings to gain skills and along with that maintain a proper Work Life Balance.

    <p class="text"><span class="laquo">&nbsp;</span>Principal Global Services being the first company of my career I had no idea what to expect out of it. In general I had not heard much good about doing a job in the IT sector, from the working professionals I knew. As a result I was a bit apprehensive before joining. Moreover I was a Mechanical Engineer in an IT industry... As of today I have no qualms in accepting how wrong my thinking was! Its been over a year and this turned out to be one of the best decisions that I ever took. Be it the training or the culture or the work life balance or the caring people, or maybe it was all of it together that forced me to change my outlook. The most overwhelming feeling that I have now is Pride. Pride to be associated with the Principal!<span class="raquo">&nbsp;</span></p>

One of the most wonderful things I found here is that PGS gives a chance to all irrespective of branch, backlogs, year down, etc. This is not to say that the caliber of those recruited here is poor, but everyone have to go to through a tough selection process to prove their mettle. One more important thing here at PGS is that it has a very good training program, which sets it apart from most of other companies. PGS takes its trainees and thus, training, very seriously. The teams are supportive to the new joiners. Many opportunities for growth, innovation, working on new technologies are available are promoted by Leaders here.
