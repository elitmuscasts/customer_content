									<li>
										In today's world CVs are copied and candidate crack tests by sheer preparation. So companies end up hiring below par candidates. 
									</li>
									<li>
										Devise a strategy and approximate implementation also to shortlist candidate for three job families basis their behaviour on eLitmus. This could change for each of the job families. Assume three job families to be  BPO , software and accounting. You can think on multiple dimensions. While thinking implementation, you may not reproduce whole code but refer to corresponding algorithms / wiki links etc. Few examples of behaviours and / or strategy is given below.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Example 1: </strong>  a candidate who applies to all jobs or in less than x seconds of clicking on job ad (meaning she has not studied the job ad). 
									</li>
									<li>
						    		<strong>Example 2: </strong>   We did an interesting experiment recently. There were 3 gift cards which were made available to users (pH Test takers). A user could buy the gift cards by using eLitmus cash (which they earn by taking pH Test and/ or referring friends). For a given gift card a maximum of 2 could be bought.  Candidates who bought one or two each of all three within 5 minutes interval with a 97% probability did not have a high pH Score. This behaviour could be leveraged for job family like BPO where taking a pH Test or any other written test is irrelevant.
