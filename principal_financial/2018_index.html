    <p class="text"><span class="laquo">&nbsp;</span>Principal Global Services (PGS) is a great place to kick-start your career. I joined Principal as a fresher and now it's been more than 5 years that I have been working in this organization, and the learnings and growth opportunities that I got are tremendous.

    As a trainee, there's a thorough training provided on the business as well as the technical knowledge. It is made sure that when you start working with other experienced employees you have the required skills to start grasping the vast knowledge at the same time start contributing to the projects. It gives great exposure and learnings when you collaborate with employees of Home Office (US). Working in a Fortune 500 company gives a great sense of pride, as each effort of yours would make a huge Impact.

    PGS takes care and encourages feedbacks in making sure its employees are getting the required trainings to gain skills and along with that maintain a proper Work Life Balance.

    <p class="text"><span class="laquo">&nbsp;</span>Principal Global Services being the first company of my career I had no idea what to expect out of it. In general I had not heard much good about doing a job in the IT sector, from the working professionals I knew. As a result I was a bit apprehensive before joining. Moreover I was a Mechanical Engineer in an IT industry... As of today I have no qualms in accepting how wrong my thinking was! Its been over a year and this turned out to be one of the best decisions that I ever took. Be it the training or the culture or the work life balance or the caring people, or maybe it was all of it together that forced me to change my outlook. The most overwhelming feeling that I have now is Pride. Pride to be associated with the Principal!<span class="raquo">&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p class="text"><span class="laquo">&nbsp;</span>Principal Global Services is the first company of my career. Before joining I was not sure what to expect from it and what will be expected from me but the training program here made that campus to corporate transition pretty smooth. Also people around here are easily approachable and very supportive. Apart from your technical development PGS also takes care of your personal development. Work-life balance, extra-curricular activities and Parties are few of the points to be highlighted. It's been around 2 years now and I enjoy working here.<span class="raquo">&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p class="text"><span class="laquo">&nbsp;</span>I joined Principal as a trainee graduate in July, 2014. Being a graduate in Automotive Design Engineering and joining in an IT profile, I had absolutely no idea of how and what and I am going to do. I was new to the software industry but that did not matter and the organization has supported me at every step of the way to reach wherever I want to go. You are provided trainings in required technologies and skills. The leadership also supports you with your aspirations. The only limit is your aspiration. Principal is a small family of 1200+ people and you are welcomed into a warm environment where you can approach anyone and everyone. You can openly put forward your views and ask questions. You also get opportunities to work on new technologies and bring in innovative ideas.
    Apart from the work, we regularly have fun activities, dine-out, numerous outdoor activities and many more to get to know each other better. 
    I have clocked almost 4 years at Principal and I can say that it has been a tremendous journey so far.<span class="raquo">&nbsp;</span></p>
